jsGraph
=======

An implementation of a graph ADT written in javascript.

This is a set of libraries I wrote to practice for my Algorithms & Data Structures final. I wanted to practice the material while improving my knowledge of javascript.

<h3>The repo includes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A traversals library which implements a number of common algorithms such as Dijkstra's and Topological Sort.</li>

<li>A graph library which houses constructors for vertices, edges, and a graph object.</li>

<li>A visualizer using the paper.js framework.</li>
</ul>

See the demo here: http://johnnysnel.github.io/jsGraph/

Note: not everything works yet. Currently, graphs built with the visualizer can only run Dijkstraâ€™s and Prim-Jarnik's. Edges are also always randomly weighted and undirected.
