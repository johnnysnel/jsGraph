jsGraph
=======

An implementation of a graph ADT written in javascript.

This is a set of libraries I wrote to practice for my Algorithms & Data Structures final. I wanted to practice the material, while improving my knowledge of javascript.

The repo includes:
-A traversals library, which implements a number of common algorithms, such as Dijkstra's and Topological Sort.
-A graph library, which houses contructors for vertices, edges, and a graph object.
-a visualizer using the paper.js framework.
